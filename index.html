			The years [...] when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time of my
			life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later
			details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst
			forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to
			break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later
			was merely the outer classification, scientific elaboration, and the integration into
			life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then. -- Jung, 1957

			If one does not place Jung's confrontation with the unconscious in a proper perspective,
			or understand the significance of the Red Book, one is in no place to understand fully
			Jung's intellectual development from 1913 onwards, and not only that, but his life as
			well: it was his inner life which dictated his movements in the world. ... For Jung's
			work on his fantasies in Black Books and the Red Book formed the core of his later work,
			as he himself contended. The Red Book is at the center of Jung's life and work.
			[Understanding Jung] without an accurate account of it would be like writing the life of
			Dante without the Commedia, or Goethe without Faust. -- Shamdasani, 2009(?)
