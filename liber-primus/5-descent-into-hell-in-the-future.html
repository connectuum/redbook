		<a href="#fn81" class="fn">81</a> In the following night, the air was filled with many
		voices. A loud voice called: "I am falling." Others cried out, confused and excited during
		this: "Where to? What do you want?" Should I entrust myself to this confusion? I shuddered.
		It is a dreadful deep. Do you want me to leave myself to chance, to the madness of my own
		darkness? Wither? Wither? You fall, and I want to fall with you, whoever you are.
	</p>
	<p>
		The spirit of the depths opened my eyes and I caught a glimpse of the inner things, the
		world of my soul, the many-formed and changing.

	<p>
		I see a gray rock face along which I sink into great depths.<a href="#fn82"
			class="fn">82</a> I stand in black dirt up to my ankles in a dark cave. Shadows sweep
		over me. I am seized by fear, but I know I must go in. I crawl through a narrow crack in the
		rock and reach an inner cave whose bottom is covered with black water. But beyond this I
		catch a glimpse of luminous red stone which I must reach. I wade through the muddy water.
		The cave is full of the frightful noise of shrieking voices.<a href="#fn83"
			class="fn">83</a> I take the stone, it covers a dark opening in the rock. I hold the
		stone in my hand, peering around inquiringly. I do not want to listen to the voices, they
		keep me away.<a href="#fn84" class="fn">84</a> But I want to know. Here something wants to
		be uttered. I place my ear to the opening. I hear the flow of underground waters. I see the
		bloody head of a man on the dark stream. Someone wounded, someone slain floats there. I take
		in this image for a long time, shuddering. I see a large black scarab floating past on the
		dark stream.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the deepest reach of the stream shines a red sun, radiating through the dark water. There
		I see -- and a terror seizes me -- small serpents on the dark rock walls, striving toward
		the depths, where the sun shines. A thousand serpents crowd around, veiling the sun. Deep
		night falls. A red stream of blood, thick, red blood springs up, surging for a long time,
		then ebbing. I am seized by fear. What did I see?<a href="#fn85" class="fn">85</a>

		Heal the wounds that doubt inflicts on me, my soul. That, too, is to be overcome, so that I
		can recognize your supreme meaning. How far away everything is, and how I have turned back!
		My spirit is a spirit of torment, it tears asunder my contemplation, it would dismantle
		everything and rip it apart. I am still a victim of my thinking. When can I order my
		thinking to be quiet, so that my thoughts, those unruly hounds, will crawl to my feet? How
		can I ever hope to hear your voice louder, to see your face clearer, when all my thoughts
		howl?
	</p>
	<p>
		I am stunned, but I want to be stunned, since I have sworn to you, my soul, to trust you
		even if you lead me through madness. How shall I ever walk under your sun if I do not drink
		the bitter draught of slumber to the lees? Help me so that I do not choke on my own
		knowledge. The fullness of my knowledge threatens to fall in on me. My knowledge has a
		thousand voices, an army roaring like lions; the air trembles when they speak, and I am
		their defenseless sacrifice. Keep it far from me, science, that clever
		knower,<a href="#fn86" class="fn">86</a> that bad prison master who binds the soul and
		imprisons it in a lightless cell. But above all protect me from the serpent of judgment,
		which only appears to be a healing serpent, yet in your depths is infernal poison and
		agonizing death. I want to go down cleansed into your depths with white garments and not
		rush in like some thief, seizing whatever I can and fleeing breathlessly. Let me persist in
		divine<a href="#fn87" class="fn">87</a> astonishment, so that I am ready to behold your
		wonders. Let me lay my head on a stone before your door, so that I am prepared to receive
		your light.

	<p>
		When the desert begins to bloom, it brings forth strange plants. You will consider yourself
		mad, and in a certain sense, you will in fact be mad.<a href="#fn88" class="fn">88</a> To
		the extent that the Christianity of this time lacks madness, it lacks divine life. Take note
		of what the ancients taught us in images: madness is divine.<a href="#fn89"
			class="fn">89</a> But because the ancients lived this image concretely in events, it
		became a deception for us, since we became masters of the reality of the world. It is
		unquestionable: if you enter into the world of the soul, you are like a madman, and a doctor
		would consider you to be sick. What I say here can be seen as sickness, but no one can see
		it as sickness more than I do.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is how I overcame madness. If you do not know what divine madness is, suspend judgment
		and wait for the fruits.<a href="#fn90" class="fn">90</a> But know that there is a divine
		madness which is nothing other than the over-powering of the spirit of this time through the
		spirit of the depths. Speak then of sick delusion when the spirit of the depths can no
		longer stay down and forces a man to speak in tongues instead of in human speech, and makes
		him believe that he himself is the spirit of the depths. But also speak of sick delusion
		when the spirit of this time does not leave a man and forces him to see only the surface, to
		deny the spirit of the depths and to take himself for the spirit of the times. The spirit of
		this time is ungodly, the spirit of the depths is ungodly, balance is godly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because I was caught up in the spirit of this time, precisely what happened to me on this
		night had to happen to me, namely that the spirit of the depths erupted with force, and
		swept away the spirit of this time with a powerful wave. But the spirit of the depths had
		gained this power, because I had spoken to my soul during 25 nights in the desert and I had
		given her all my love and submission. But during the 25 days, I gave all my love and
		submission to things, to men, and to the thoughts of this time. I went into the desert only
		at night.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus can you differentiate sick and divine delusion. Whoever does the one, and does without
		the other, you may call sick, since he is out of balance.
	</p>
	<p>
		But who can withstand fear when the divine intoxication and madness comes to him? Love,
		soul, and God are beautiful and terrible. The ancients brought over some of the beauty of
		God into this world, and this world became so beautiful that it appeared to the spirit of
		the time to be fulfillment, and better than the bosom of the Godhead. The frightfulness and
		cruelty of the world lay under wraps and in the depths of our hearts. If the spirit of the
		depths seizes you, you will feel the cruelty and cry out in torment. The spirit of the
		depths is pregnant with ice, fire, and death. You are right to fear the spirit of the
		depths, as he is full of horror.
	</p>
	<p>
		You see in these days what the spirit of the depths bore. You did not believe it, but you
		would have known it if you had taken counsel with your fear.<a href="#fn91"
			class="fn">91</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Blood shone at me from the red light of the crystal, and when I picked it up to discover its
		mystery, there lay the horror uncovered before me: in the depths of what is to come lay
		murder. The blond hero lay slain. The black beetle is the death that is necessary for
		renewal, and so thereafter, a new sun glowed, the sun of the depths, full of riddles, a sun
		of the night. And as the rising sun of spring quickens the dead earth, so the sun of the
		depths quickened the dead, and thus began the terrible struggle between light and darkness.
		Out of that burst the powerful and ever unvanquished source of blood. This was what was to
		come, which you now experience in your life, and it is even more than that. (I had this
		vision on the night of 12 December 1913.)

		Depths and surface should mix so that new life can develop. Yet the new life does not
		develop outside of us, but within us. What happens outside us in these days is the image
		that the peoples live in events, to bequeath this image immemorially to far-off times so
		that they might learn from it for their own way, just as we learned from the images that the
		ancients had lived before us in events.

		Therefore I take part in that murder; the sun of the depths also shines in me after the

			class="fn">93</a> The upwelling blood streams out of me.
	</p>
	<p>
		You all have a share in the murder.<a href="#fn94" class="fn">94</a> In you the reborn one
		will come to be, and the sun of the depths will rise, and a thousand serpents will develop

		But I ask you, when do men fall on their brothers with mighty weapons and bloody acts? They
		do such if they do not know that their brother is themselves. They themselves are
		sacrificers, but they mutually do the service of sacrifice. They must all sacrifice each
		other, since the time has not yet come when man puts the bloody knife into himself in order
		to sacrifice the one, he lulls in his brother. But whom do people lull? They lull the noble,
		the brave, the heroes. They take aim at these and do not know that with these they mean
		themselves. They should sacrifice the hero in themselves, and because they do not know this,
		they kill their courageous brother.
	</p>
	<p>
		The time is still not ripe. But through this blood sacrifice, it should ripen. So long as it
		is possible to murder the brother instead of oneself, the time is not ripe. Frightful things
		must happen until men grow ripe. But anything else will not ripen humanity. Hence all this
		that takes place in these days must also be, so that the renewal can come. Since the source
		of blood that follows the shrouding of the sun is also the source of the new
		life.<a href="#fn96" class="fn">96</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		As the fate of the peoples is represented to you in events, so will it happen in your heart.
		If the hero in you is slain, then the sun of the depths rises in you, glowing from afar, and
		from a dreadful place. But all the same, everything that, up til now, seemed to be dead in
		you will come to life, and will change into poisonous serpents that will cover the sun, and
		you will fall into night and confusion. Your blood also will stream from many wounds in this
		frightful struggle. Your shock and doubt will be great, but from such torment the new life
		will be born. Birth is blood and torment. Your darkness, which you did not suspect since it
		was dead, will come to life, and you will feel the crush of total evil and the conflicts of
		life that still now lie buried in the matter of your body. But the serpents are dreadful
		evil thoughts and feelings.
	</p>
	<p>
		You thought you knew that abyss? Oh you clever people! It is another thing to experience it.
		Everything will happen to you. Think of all the frightful and devilish things that men have
		inflicted on their brothers. That should happen to you in your heart, Suffer it yourself
		through your own hand, and know that it is your own heinous and devilish hand that inflicts
		the suffering on you, but not your brother, who wrestles with his own
		devils.<a href="#fn97" class="fn">97</a>

		I would like you to see what the murdered hero means. Those nameless men who in our day have
		murdered a prince are blind prophets who demonstrate in events what then is valid only for
		the soul.<a href="#fn98" class="fn">98</a> Through the murder of princes we will learn that
		the prince in us, the hero, is threatened.<a href="#fn99" class="fn">99</a> Whether this
		should be seen as a good or a bad sign need not concern us. What is awful today is good in a
		hundred years, and in two hundred years is bad again. But we must recognize what is
		happening: there are nameless ones in you who threaten your prince, the hereditary ruler.
	</p>
	<p>
		But our ruler is the spirit of this time, which rules and leads in us all. It is the general
		spirit in which we think and act today. He is of frightful power, since he has brought
		immeasurable good to this world and fascinated men with unbelievable pleasure. He is
		bejeweled with the most beautiful heroic virtue, and wants to drive men up to the brightest
		solar heights, in everlasting ascent.<a href="#fn100" class="fn">100</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The hero wants to open up everything he can. But the nameless spirit of the depths evokes
		everything that man cannot. Incapacity prevents further ascent. Greater height requires
		greater virtue. We do not possess it. We must first create it by learning to live with our
		incapacity. We must give it life. For how else shall it develop into ability?
	</p>
	<p>
		We cannot slay our incapacity and rise above it. But that is precisely what we wanted.
		Incapacity will overcome us and demand its share of life. Our ability will desert us, and we
		will believe, in the sense of the spirit of this time, that it is a loss. Yet it is no loss
		but a gain, not for outer trappings, however, but for inner capability.
	</p>
	<p>
		The one who learns to live with his incapacity has learned a great deal. This will lead us
		to the valuation of the smallest things, and to wise limitation, which the greater height
		demands. If all heroism is erased, we fall back into the misery of humanity and into even
		worse. Our foundations will be caught up in excitement since our highest tension, which
		concerns what lies outside us, will stir them up. We will fall into the cesspool of our
		underworld, among the rubble of all the centuries in us.<a href="#fn101" class="fn">101</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The heroic in you is the fact that you are ruled by the thought that this or that is good,
		that this or that performance is indispensable, this or that cause is objectionable, this or
		that goal must be attained in headlong striving work, this or that pleasure should be
		ruthlessly repressed at all costs. Consequently, you sin against incapacity. But incapacity
		exists. No one should deny it, find fault with it, or shout it
		down.<a href="#fn102" class="fn">102</a>

				beetle of course I knew to be an ancient sun symbol, and the setting sun, the
				luminous red disk, was archetypal. The serpents I thought might have been connected
				with Egyptian material. I could not then realize that it was all so archetypal, I

				The theme of divine madness has a long history Its locus classics was Socrates's
				discussion of it in the Phaedrusz madness, "provided it comes as a gift of heaven,
				is the channel by which we receive the greatest blessings" (Flato, Fhaedrus and
				Letters VII and VIII, or. W Hamilton [I.ondon: Penguin, 1986], p. 46, line 2.44).
				Socrates distin- guished four types of divine madness: (39 inspired divination, such
				as by the prophetess at Delphi; (2) instances in which individuals, when ancient
				sins have given rise to troubles, have prophesied and incite to prayer and worship;
				(3) possession by the Muses, since the technically sldlled untouched by the madness
				of the Muses will never be a good poet; and (4) the lover. In the Renaissance, the
				theme of divine madness was taken up by the Neoplatonists such as Ficino and by
				humanists such as Erasmus. Erasmus's discussion is particularly important, as it
				fuses the classical Platonic conception with Christianity For Erasmus, Christianity
				was the highest type of inspired madness. Like Plato, Erasmus differentiated between
				two types of madness: "Thus as long as the souL uses its bodily organs aright, a man
				is called sane; but truly when it bursts its chains and tries to be free, practising
				running away from its prison, then one calls it insanity If this happens through
				disease or a defect of the organs, then by common consent it is, plainly, insanity
				And yet men of this kind, too, we find foretelling things to come, knowing tongues
				and writings which they had never studied beforehand-altogether showing forth
				something divine" (In Praise ofFolly, or. M. A. Screech [London Penguin, 1988], pp.
				Iz8-29). He adds that if insanity "happens through divine fervor, it may not be the
				same kind of insanity but it is so like it that most people make no distinction."
				For lay people, the two forms of insanity appeared the same. The happiness that
				Christians sought was "nothing other than a certain land of madness." Those who
				experience this "experience some- thing which is very like madness. They speak
				incoherently and unnaturally utter sound without sense, and their faces suddenly
				change expression ... in fact they are truly beside themselves" (ibid., pp. 129-33).
				In 1815, the philosopher F.W]. Schelling discussed divine madness in a manner that
				has a certain proximity to Jung's discus- sion, noting that "The ancients did not
				speak in vain of a divine and holy madness." Schelling related this to the "inner
				self-laceration of nature." He held that "nothing great can be accomplished without
				a constant solicitation of madness, which should always be overcome, but should
				never be entirely lacing." On the one hand, there were sober spirits in whom there
				was no trace of madness, together with men of understanding who produced cold
				intellectual works. On the other, "there is one kind of person that governs madness
				and precisely in this overwhelming shows the highest force of the intellect. The
				other kind of person is governed by madness and is some- one who is really mad" (The
				AgesoftheWorld,or. J. Wirth [Albanyz SUNY Press, 2000], pp. 102-4) .

				An application of William James's notion of the pragmatic rule. Jung read James's
				Pragmatism in 1912, and it had a strong impact on his thinking. In his foreword to
				his Fordham University lectures, Jung stated that he had taken Jarnes's pragmatic
				rule as his guiding principle (cw 4, p. 86). See myjung and the Making0.fModern

				The Draft continues: "The spirit of the depths was so alien to me that it took me
				twenty-five nights to comprehend him. And even then he was still so alien that I
				could neither see nor ask. He had to come to me as a stranger from far away and from
				an unheard-of side. He had to call me. I could not address him, knowing him and his
				nature. He announced himself with a loud voice, as in a warlike turmoil with the
				manifold clamoring of the voices of this time. The spirit of this time arose in me
				against this stranger, and uttered a battle cry together with his many serfs. I
				heard the noise of this battle in the air. Then the spirit of the depths burst forth
				and led me to the site of the innermost. But he had reduced the spirit of this time
				to a dwarf who was clever and bustling, yet was a dwarf And the vision showed me the
				spirit of this time as made of leather, that is, pressed together sere and lifeless.
				He could not prevent me from entering the dark underworld of the spirit of the
				depths. To my astonishment I realized that my feet sank into the black muddy water
				of the river of death. [The Corrected DnyDt adds: "for that is where death is p. 41]

				In "Transformation symbolism in the mass, ' (1942), Jung commented on the motif of

				century Jung noted: "What I sacrifice is my egotistical claim, and by doing this I
				give up myself. Every sacrifice is therefore, to a greater or lesser degree, a
				self-sacrifice" (cw II, §397). Cf also the Katha Upanishad, ch. 2, verse 19. Jung
				cited the next two verses of the Katha Upanishad on the nature of the self in 1921
				(cw 6, §329). There is a line in the margin of Jung's copy by these verses in the
				Sacred BooksoftheEast, vol, XV, pt. 2, p. II. In "Dreams," Jung noted in connection
				with a dream "My intensive unconscious relation to India in the Red Book" (P. 9).

				In his lecture at the ETH on ]one 14, 1935, Jung commented (partially in reference
				to this fantasy which he referred to anonymously): "The sun motif appears in many
				places and times and the meaning is always the same-that a new consciousness has
				been born. It is the light of illumination which is projected into space. This is a
				psychological event; the medical term "hallucination" makes no sense in psychology /
				The Katabasis plays a very important role in the Middle Ages and the old masters
				conceived of the rising sun in this Katabasis as of a new light, the lux moderner,
				the jewel, the lapis" (Modern Psychology, p.231).

				The Dot continues: "My friends, I know that I speNt in riddles. But the spirit of
				the depths has granted me a view of many things in order to help my weds
				comprehension. I want to tell you more about my visions so that you better
				understand which things the spirit of the depths would like you to see. May those be
				well who can see these things! Those who cannot must live them as blind fate, in
				images" (P. 61).

				In The Relations between the I and the Unconscious (1927), Jung refers to the

				Political assassinations were frequent at the beginning of the twentieth century The
				particular event referred to here is the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
				Martin Gilbert describes this event, which played a critical role in the events that
				led to the outbreak of the First World War, as "a turning point in the history of
				the twentieth century" (A History of the Twentieth Century: Volume One: 1900-1933

				On Lune 9, I9I7; there was a discussion on the psychology of the world war in the
				Association for Analytical Fsychology following a presentation by Jules Vodoz on the
				Song of Roland. Jung argued that "Hypothetically the World War can be raised to the
				subjective level, In detail, the authoritarian principle ltaldng action on the basis
				of principles) clashes with the emotional principle. The collective unconscious
				enters into allegiance with the emotional." Concerning the hero, he said: "The
				hero-the beloved figure of the people, should fall. All heroes bring themselves down
				by carrying the heroic attitude beyond a certain limit, and hence lose their
				footing" (MAP, vol. 2, p. Io). The psychological interpretation of the First World
				War on the subjective level describes what is developed in this chapter. The
				connection between indi- vidual and collective psychology which he articulates here
				forms one of the leitmotifs of his later work of Present and Future 119571, CW 10) .
