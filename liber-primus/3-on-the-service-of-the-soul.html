		<a href="#fn63" class="fn">63</a> On the following night I had to write down all the dreams
		that I could recollect, true to their wording.<a href="#fn64" class="fn">64</a> The meaning
		of this act was dark to me. Why all this? Forgive the fuss that rises in me. Yet you want me
		to do this. What strange things are happening to me? <hi>I know too much not to see on what
		swaying bridges I go. Where are you leading me? Forgive my
		excessive apprehension, brimful of knowledge.</hi> My foot hesitates to follow you. Into
		what mist and darkness does your path lead? Must I also learn to do without meaning? If this
		is what you demand, then so be it. This hour belongs to you. <hi>What is there, where there
		is no meaning? Only nonsense, or madness, it seems to me. Is there also a supreme meaning?
		Is that your meaning, my soul? I limp after you on crutches of understanding.</hi> I am a
		man and you stride like a God. What torture! I must return to myself, to my smallest things.
		<hi>I saw the things of my soul as small, pitiably small. You force me to see them as large,
			to make them large.</hi> Is that your aim? I follow but it terrifies me. <hi>Hear my
		doubts, otherwise I cannot follow, since your meaning is a supreme meaning, and your steps
		are the steps of a God.</hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		I understand, I must not think either; <hi>should thought, too, no longer be? I should give
		myself completely into your hands -- but who are you? I do not trust you.</hi> Not once to
		trust, is that my love for you, my joy in you? Do I not trust every valiant man, and not
		you, my soul? Your hand lies heavy on me, but I will, I will. <hi>Have I not sought to love
		men and trust them, and should I not do this with you? Forget my doubts, I know it is
		ignoble to doubt you. You know how difficult it is for me to set aside the beggar's pride I
		take in my own thought. I forgot that you are also one of my friends, and have the first
		right to my trust. Should what I give them not belong to you? I recognize my injustice.</hi>
		It seems to me that I despised you. My joy at finding you again was not genuine. I also
		recognize that the scornful laughter in me was right.
	</p>
	<p>
		<hi>I must learn to love you.</hi><a href="#fn65" class="fn">65</a> <hi>Should I also set
		aside self-judgment? I am afraid.</hi> Then the soul spoke to me and said:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		this fear testifies against me!
	</say>

	<p>
		It is true, it testifies against you. <hi>It kills the holy Trust between you and me.</hi>

		How hard is fate! <hi>If you take a step toward your soul, you will at first miss the
		meaning. You will believe that you have sunk into meaninglessness, into eternal disorder.
		You will be <em>right!</em> Nothing will deliver you from disorder and meaninglessness,
		since this is <b>the other half of the world.</b></hi>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		<hi>Your God is a child, so long as <em>you</em> are not childlike.</hi> Is the child order,
		meaning? Or disorder, caprice? <hi>Disorder and meaninglessness are the mother of order and
		meaning. Order and meaning are things that <b>have become</b> and are <b>no longer
			becoming.</b></hi>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		<hi>You open the gates of the soul to let the dark flood of chaos flow into your order and
			meaning. If you marry the ordered to the chaos, <b>you produce the divine child, the
				supreme meaning,</b> beyond meaning and meaninglessness.</hi>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		You are afraid to open the door? <hi>I too was afraid, since we had forgotten that God is
		terrible. Christ taught: God is love.</hi><a href="#fn66" class="fn">66</a> <hi>But you
		should know that love is also terrible.</hi>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		I spoke to a loving soul and <hi>as I drew nearer to her, I was overcome by horror, and I
		heaped up a wall of doubt,</hi> and did not anticipate that I thus <hi>wanted to protect
		myself from my fearful soul.</hi>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		<hi>You dread the depths; it <em>should</em> horrify you, since the way of what is to come
			leads through it. You must endure the <b>temptation of fear and doubt,</b> and at the
			<em>same time</em> acknowledge to the bone that your <b>fear is justified</b> and your
			<b>doubt is reasonable.</b> How otherwise could it be a <b>True temptation</b> and a
			<b>True overcoming?</b></hi>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		Christ totally overcomes the temptation of the devil, <hi>but not the temptation of God to
		<b>good and reason.</b></hi><a href="#fn67" class="fn">67</a> Christ thus succumbs to
		cursing.<a href="#fn68" class="fn">68</a>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		<hi>You still <b>have to learn this,</b> to succumb to no temptation, but to do everything

		I have had to recognize that <hi>I must submit to what I fear;</hi> yes, even more, that
		<hi>I must even love what horrifies me.</hi> We must learn such from that saint who was
		disgusted by the plague infections; she drank the pus of plague boils and became aware that
		it smelled like roses. <hi>The acts of the saint were not in
		vain.</hi><a href="#fn69" class="fn">69</a>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		<hi>In everything regarding your salvation and the attainment of mercy, you are <b>dependent
			on your soul.</b> Thus no sacrifice can be too great for you. If your virtues hinder you
			from salvation, discard them, since they have become evil to you. The slave to
			<em>virtue</em> finds the way as little as the slave to
			<em>vices.</em></hi><a href="#fn70" class="fn">70</a>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		<hi>If you believe that you are the <em>master</em> of your soul, then become her
			<em>servant.</em> If you were her <em>servant</em>, make yourself her <em>master</em>,
			since she needs to be ruled. <b>These should be your first steps.</b></hi>

		During six further nights, the spirit of the depths was silent in me, <hi>since I swayed
		between fear, defiance, and nausea, and was wholly the prey of my passion.</hi> I could not
		and did not want to listen to the depths. But on the seventh night, the spirit of the depths
		spoke to
		me:
	</p>

	<say class="depths">
		<hi>look into your depths,<br/>
			pray to your depths,<br/>
			<b><em>waken the dead.</em></b></hi><a href="#fn71" class="fn">71</a>
	</say>

	<p>
		<hi>But I stood helpless and did not know what I could do.</hi> I looked into myself, and
		the only thing I found within was the memory of earlier dreams, <hi>all of which I wrote
		down without knowing what good this would do.</hi> I wanted to throw everything away and
		return to the light of day. <hi>But the spirit stopped me and forced me back into
		myself.</hi>

				In Black Book 2, Jungnoted here: "Here, someone stands beside me
				and whispers terrible things into my ear: 'You write to be printed and circulated
				among people. You want to cause a stir through the unusual. Nietzsche did this
				better than you. You are imitating Saint Augustine' " (P. to). The reference is to
				Augustine's Confessions 14oo CE), a devotional work written when he was forty-five
				years old in, which he narrates his conversion to Christianity in an
				autobiographical form (Caqf√©ssions, to. HC adwick Oxford: Oxford University Press,
				1991]). The Confessions are addressed to God, and recount the years of his
				wandering from God and the manner of his return. Echoing this in the opening
				sections ofLiber Novus, Jung addresses his soul and recounts the years of his
				wandering away from her, and the manner of his return. In his published works, lung
				frequently cited Augustine, and referred to his Confessions several times in
				Transformations and Symbols of the Libido.

				disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!" In
				1944 Jung wrote; "The Christian-my Christian-knows no curse formulas; indeed he does
