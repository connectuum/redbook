		that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
		acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and <hi>we

	<p>
		If I speak in the spirit of this time,<a href="#fn5" class="fn">5</a> I must say: no one
		and nothing can justify what I must proclaim to you. Justification is superfluous to me,
		since <hi>I have no choice,</hi> but I must.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have learned that in addition to the spirit of this time there is still
		another spirit at work, namely that which rules the depths of everything
		contemporary:<a href="#fn6" class="fn">6</a> The spirit of this time would like to hear
		of use and value. I also thought this way, and my humanity still thinks this way. <hi>But
		that other spirit forces me nevertheless to speak, <b>beyond justification, use, and
			meaning.</b></hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		Filled with human pride and blinded by the presumptuous spirit of the times, <hi>I long
		sought to hold that other spirit away from me.</hi> But I did not consider that the spirit
		of the depths from time immemorial and for all the future <hi>possesses a greater
		power than the spirit of this time, who changes with the generations.</hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		The <hi>spirit of the depths has subjugated all pride and arrogance to the power of
		judgment</hi>. He took away my <hi>belief in science</hi>, he robbed me of <hi>the joy of
		explaining and ordering</hi> things, and he let <hi>devotion to the ideals of this
		time</hi> die out in me. He forced me down to the <hi>last and simplest things.</hi>
	</p>

	<idea>
		power of judgment = the feeling of (and/or resonance with) Truth? the mental-highlighter
		that marks phrases and images as important or meaningful?
	</idea>

	<p>
		The spirit of the depths took my understanding and all my knowledge and placed them <hi>at
		the service of the inexplicable and the paradoxical. He robbed me of speech and writing for
		everything that was not in his service,</hi> namely <hi><b>the melting together of sense and
		nonsense</b>, which produces <b>the supreme meaning.</b></hi>
	</p>

	<idea>
		disorientation and under/over-relation are tools used to teach <b>associative mind.</b>

		The spirit of this time in me wanted to recognize the greatness and extent of the
		supreme meaning, but not its littleness. The spirit of the depths, however, conquered
		this arrogance, and I had to swallow the small as <hi>a means of healing the immortal in
		me.</hi> It completely burnt up my innards since it was inglorious and unheroic. It was even
		ridiculous and revolting. But the pliers of the spirit of the depths held me, and I had
		to drink the bitterest of all draughts.<a href="#fn9" class="fn">9</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The spirit of this time tempted me with the thought that all this belongs to the
		shadowiness of the God-image. This would be pernicious deception, since the shadow is
		nonsense. But the small, narrow, and banal is not nonsense, but one of both of the
		essences of the Godhead.
	</p>
	<p>
		I resisted recognizing that the <hi>everyday belongs to the image of the Godhead.</hi> I
		fled this thought, I hid myself behind the highest and coldest stars. But the spirit of the
		depths caught up with me, and forced the bitter drink between my
		lips.<a href="#fn10" class="fn">10</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		The spirit of this time whispered to me:
	</p>

	<say class="time">
		this supreme meaning,<br/>
		this image of God,<br/>
		this melting together<br/>
		of the hot and the cold,<br/>
		that is you<br/>
		and only you.
	</say>

	<p>
		But the spirit of the depths spoke to me:<a href="#fn11" class="fn">11</a>
	</p>

	<say class="depths">
		you are <hi>an image<br/>
		of the unending world,<br/>
		all the last mysteries<br/>
		of becoming<br/>
		and passing away<br/>
		live in you.</hi><br/>
		if you did not<br/>
		possess all this,<br/>
		how could you know?
	</say>

	<p>
		For the sake of my human weakness, the spirit of the depths gave me this word. Yet this
		word is also superfluous, since I do not speak it freely but because I must. <hi>I speak
		because <b>the spirit robs me of joy and life</b> if I do not speak.</hi><a href="#fn12"
			class="fn">12</a> I am the serf who brings it and <hi>does not know what he carries in
		his hand.</hi> It would burn his hands if he did not place it where his master orders him to
		lay it.
	</p>
	<p>
		The spirit of our time spoke to me and said:
	</p>

	<say class="time">
		what dire urgency<br/>
		could be <em>forcing</em> you<br/>
		to speak<br/>
		all this?
	</say>

	<p>
		This was an awful temptation. I wanted to ponder what inner or outer bind could force me
		into this, and because I found nothing that I could grasp, I was near to making one up. But
		with this the spirit of our time had almost brought it about that instead of speaking, <hi>I
		was thinking again about reasons and explanations.</hi> But the spirit of the depths spoke
		to me and said:
	</p>

	<say class="depths">
		<hi><b>to understand</b> a thing<br/>
			is a bridge<br/>
			and possibility<br/>
			of returning to the path.<br/>
			but <b>to explain</b> a matter<br/>
			is arbitrary<br/>
			and sometimes even<br/>
			<em>murder</em>.</hi><br/>
		have you counted<br/>
		the murderers<br/>
		among the scholars?
	</say>

	<p>
		But the spirit of this time stepped up to me and laid before me huge volumes which
		contained all my knowledge. Their pages were made of ore, and a steel stylus had
		engraved inexorable words in them, and he pointed to these inexorable words and spoke to
		me, and said:
	</p>

	<say class="time">
		what you speak,<br/>
		that<br/>
		is<br/>
		<em>madness.</em>
	</say>

	<p>
		It is true, it is true, <hi>what I speak is the greatness and intoxication and ugliness of
		madness.</hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		But the spirit of the depths stepped up to me and said:
	</p>

	<say class="depths">
		<hi>what you speak<br/>
			<b><em>is.</em></b><br/>
			<br/>
			the greatness<br/>
			<b><em>is,</em></b><br/>

			<b><em>is,</em></b><br/>

			<b><em>is.</em></b></hi><br/>
		<br/>
		it runs in all the streets,<br/>

		<hi>and rules the day<br/>

		even the eternal stars<br/>

		<hi>and the <b>one essence</b> of God.</hi><br/>
		one laughs about it,<br/>
		and laughter, too,<br/>
		<b><em>is.</em></b><br/>
		<br/>
		<hi>do you believe,<br/>
			<em>man of this time</em>,<br/>
			that laughter is lower than worship?<br/>
			<b>where is your measure, false measurer?</b></hi><a href="#fn13" class="fn">13</a><br/>
		<hi>the sum of life<br/>

			and in worship,<br/>
			<b>not your judgment.</b></hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		I must also speak the ridiculous. You coming men! You will recognize the supreme meaning
		by the fact that he is laughter and worship, a bloody laughter and a bloody worship. <hi>A
		sacrificial blood binds the poles. Those who know this laugh and worship in the same
		breath.</hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		After this, however, my humanity approached me and said:
	</p>

	<say class="humanity">
		<hi>what solitude,<br/>
			what coldness of desolation you lay upon me<br/>
			when you speak such!</hi><br/>
		<br/>
		<b><em>reflect</em></b><br/>
		on the destruction of being<br/>
		and the streams of blood<br/>
		<hi>from the terrible sacrifice<br/>
			that the depths demand.</hi><a href="#fn14" class="fn">14</a>
	</say>

	<p>
		But the spirit of the depths said:
	</p>

	<say class="depths">
		<hi>no one can<br/>
			or should<br/>
			halt sacrifice.<br/>
			<br/>
			sacrifice is not destruction,<br/>
			<b>sacrifice is the foundation stone<br/>

			would break all chains.<br/>
			<br/>
			truly<br/>
			<b>i prepare you<br/>
				for solitude.</b></hi>

	<p>
		After this, my humanity remained silent. Something happened to my spirit, however, which
		<hi>I must call <b>mercy.</b></hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		<hi>My speech is imperfect.</hi> Not because I want to shine with words, but <hi>out of the
		impossibility of finding those words, <b>I speak in images.</b></hi> With nothing else can I
		express the words from the depths.
	</p>
	<p>
		<hi>The mercy which happened to me gave me <b>belief, hope, and sufficient daring,</b>
			not to resist further the spirit of the depths, but to utter his word.</hi> But before I
		could pull myself together to really do it, I needed a visible sign that would show me that
		<hi>the spirit of the <b>depths in me</b> was at the same time the ruler of the <b>depths of
			world affairs.</b></hi>

		<a href="#fn15" class="fn">15</a> It happened in October of the year 1913 as I was leaving
		alone for a journey, that during the day I was suddenly overcome in broad daylight by a
		vision: I saw a terrible flood that covered all the northern and lowflying lands between the
		North Sea and the Alps. It reached from England up to Russia, and from the coast of the
		North Sea right up to the Alps. I saw yellow waves, swimming rubble, and <hi>the death of
		countless thousands.</hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		This vision lasted for two hours, it confused me and made me ill. I was not able to
		interpret it. Two weeks passed then the vision returned, still more violent than before, and
		<hi>an inner voice spoke: "<b>Look at it</b>, it is completely real, and <b>it will come to
			pass.</b> You cannot doubt this."</hi> I wrestled again for two hours with this vision,
		but it held me fast. It left me exhausted and confused. And <hi>I thought my mind had gone
		crazy.</hi><a href="#fn16" class="fn">16</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		From then on the anxiety toward the terrible event that stood directly before us kept coming
		back. Once I also saw a sea of blood over the northern lands.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the year 1914 in the month of June, at the beginning and end of the month, and at the
		beginning of July, I had the same dream three times: I was in a foreign land, and suddenly
		overnight and right in the middle of summer, a terrible cold descended from space. All seas
		and rivers were locked in ice, every green living thing had frozen.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second dream was thoroughly similar to this. But the third dream at the beginning of
		July went as follows:
	</p>
	<p>
		I was in a remote English land.<a href="#fn17" class="fn">17</a> It was necessary that I
		return to my homeland with a fast ship as speedily as possible.<a href="#fn18"
			class="fn">18</a> I reached home quickly.<a href="#fn19" class="fn">19</a> In my
		homeland I found that in the middle of summer a terrible cold had fallen from space, which
		had turned every living thing into ice. There stood a leaf-bearing but fruitless tree, whose
		leaves had turned into sweet grapes full of healing juice through the working of the
		frost.<a href="#fn20" class="fn">20</a> I picked some grapes and gave them to a great
		waiting throng.<a href="#fn21" class="fn">21</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		In reality now, it was so: At the time when the great war broke out between the peoples of
		Europe, I found myself in Scotland,<a href="#fn22" class="fn">22</a> compelled by the war to
		choose the fastest ship and the shortest route home. <hi>I encountered the colossal cold
		that froze everything, I met up with the flood, the sea of blood, and found my barren tree
		whose leaves the frost had transformed into a remedy.</hi> And I plucked the ripe fruit and
		gave it to you and I do not know what I poured out for you, what bitter-sweet intoxicating
		drink, which left on your tongues an aftertaste of blood.

				Medieval manuscripts were numbered by folios instead of pages. The front side of the

				In 1921, Jung cited this passage, noting: "The nature of the redeeming symbol is
				that of a child, that is the childlikeness or presuppositionlessness of the attitude
				belongs to the symbol and its function. This 'childlike' attitude necessarily brings
				with it another guiding principle in place of self-will and rational intentions,
				whose 'godlikeness' is synonymous with 'superiority' Since it is of an irrational
				nature, the guiding principle appears in a miraculous form. Isaid'l expresses his
				connection very well (915) ...These honorific titles reproduce the essential
				qualities of the redeeming symbol. The criterion of 'godlike' effect is the
				irresistible power of the unconscious impulses" (Psychological Types, CW 6,

				In 1955/56, Jung noted that the union of the opposites of the destructive and

				In Trangbrmations and Symbo s of the Libido 1912> Jung interpreted God as a symbol

				The spirit of the depth demands this, who is beyond present and past. Speak and

				do not soil the dignity ofhumanity-it is a rare good. A sad deniise in dignity is
				better than an undignified healing. Whoever wants to be a doctor of the soul sees
				people as being sick. He offends human dignity. It is presumptuous to say that man
				is sick. Whoever wants to be the soul's shepherd treats people like sheep. He
				violates human dignity. It is insolent to say that people are like sheep. Who gives
				you the right to say that man is sick and a sheep? Give him human dignity so he may
				find his ascendancy or downfall, his way" (p. II).
