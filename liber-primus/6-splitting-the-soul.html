	<p>
		But on the fourth night I cried:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		To journey to Hell means to become Hell oneself.<a href="#fn103" class="fn">103</a> It is
		all frightfully muddled and interwoven. On this desert path there is not just glowing sand,
		but also horrible tangled invisible beings who live in the desert. I didn't know this. The
		way is only apparently clear, the desert is only apparently empty It seems inhabited by
		magical beings who murderously attach themselves to me and daimonically change my form. I
		have evidently taken on a completely monstrous form in which I can no longer recognize
		myself. It seems to me that I have become a monstrous animal form for which I have exchanged
		my humanity This way is surrounded by hellish magic, invisible nooses have been thrown over
		me and ensnare me.
	</say>

	<p>
		But the spirit of the depths approached me and said:
	</p>
	<say class="depths">
		Climb down into your depths, sink!
	</say>

	<p>
		But I was indignant at him and said:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		How can I sink? I am unable to do this myself
	</say>

	<p>
		Then the spirit spoke words to me that appeared ridiculous, and he said:
	</p>
	<say class="depths">
		Sit yourself down, be calm.
	</say>

	<p>
		But I cried out indignantly:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		How frightful, it sounds like nonsense, do you also demand this of me? You overthrew the
		mighty Gods who mean the most to us. My soul, where are you? Have I entrusted myself to a
		stupid animal, do I stagger like a drunkard to the grave, do I stammer stupidities like a
		lunatic? Is this your way my soul? The blood boils in me and I would strangle you if I could
		seize you. You weave the thickest darknesses and I am like a madman caught in your net. But
		I yearn, teach me.
	</say>

	<p>
		But my soul spoke to me saying:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		My path is light.
	</say>

	<p>
		Yet I indignantly answered:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		Do you call light what we men call the worst darkness? Do you call day night?
	</say>

	<p>
		To this my soul spoke a word that roused my anger:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		My light is not of this world.
	</say>

	<p>
		I cried:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		I know of no other world.
	</say>

	<p>
		The soul answered:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		Should it not exist because you know nothing of it?
	</say>

	<p>
		I:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		But our knowledge? Does our knowledge also not hold good for you? What is it going to be, if
		not knowledge? Where is security? Where is solid ground? Where is light? Your darkness is
		not only darker than night, but bottomless as well. If it's not going to be knowledge, then
		perhaps it will do without speech and words too?
	</say>

	<p>
		My soul:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		No words.
	</say>

	<p>
		I:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		Forgive me, perhaps I'm hard of hearing, perhaps I misinterpret you, perhaps I ensnare
		myself in self-deceit and monkey business, and I am a rascal grinning at myself in a mirror
		a fool in my own madhouse. Perhaps you stumble over my folly?
	</say>

	<p>
		My soul:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		You delude yourself, you do not deceive me. Your words are lies to you, not me.
	</say>

	<p>
		I:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		But could I wallow in raging nonsense, and hatch absurdity and perverse monotony?
	</say>

	<p>
		My soul:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		Who gives you thoughts and words? Do you make them? Are you not my serf, a recipient who
		lies at my door and picks up my alms? And you dare think that what you devise and speak
		could be nonsense? Don't you know yet that it comes from me and belongs to me?
	</say>

	<p>
		So I cried full of anger:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		But then my indignation must also come from you, and in me you are indignant against
		yourself.
	</say>

	<p>
		My soul then spoke the ambiguous words:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		That is civil war.<a href="#fn104" class="fn">104</a>
	</say>

	<p>
		I was afflicted with pain and rage, and I answered back:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		How painful, my soul, to hear you use hollow words, I feel sick. Comedy and drivel-but I
		yearn. I can also crawl through mud and the most despised banality I can also eat dust; that
		is part of Hell. I do not yield, I am defiant. You can go on devising torments, spiderlegged
		monsters, ridiculous, hideous, frightful theatrical spectacles. Come close, I am ready Ready
		my soul, you who are a devil, to wrestle with you too. You donned the mask of a God, and I
		worshiped you. Now you wear the mask of a devil, a frightful one, the mask of the banal, of
		eternal mediocrity! Only one favor! Give me a moment to step back and consider! Is the
		struggle with this mask worthwhile? Was the mask of God worth worshiping? I cannot do it,
		the lust for battle burns in my limbs. No, I cannot leave the battlefield defeated. I want
		to seize you, crush you, monkey buffoon. Woe if the struggle is unequal, my hands grab at
		air. But your blows are also air, and I perceive trickery.

		I find myself again on the desert path. It was a desert vision, a vision of the solitary who
		has wandered down long roads. There lurk invisible robbers and assassins and shooters of
		poison darts. Suppose the murderous arrow is sticldng in my heart?

		As the first vision had predicted to me, the assassin appeared from the depths, and came to
		me just as in the fate of the peoples of this time a nameless one appeared and leveled the
		murder weapon at the prince.<a href="#fn105" class="fn">105</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		I felt myself transformed into a rapacious beast. My heart glowered in rage against the high
		and beloved, against my prince and hero, just as the nameless one of the people, driven by
		greed for murder, lunged at his dear prince. Because I carried the murder in me, I foresaw
		it.<a href="#fn106" class="fn">106</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Because I carried the war in me, I foresaw it. I felt betrayed and lied to by my long. Why
		did I feel this way? He was not as I had wished him to be. He was other than I expected. He
		should be the king in my sense, not in his sense. He should be what I called ideal. My soul
		appeared to me hollow, tasteless and meaningless. But in reality what I thought of her was
		valid for my ideal.

		[...] vision of the desert, I struggled with mirror images of myself It was civil war in me.
		I myself was the murderer and the murdered. The deadly arrow was stuck in my heart, and I
		did not know what it meant. My thoughts were murder and the fear of death, which spread like
		poison everywhere in my body
	</p>
	<p>
		And thus was the fate of the people: The murder of one was the poisonous arrow that flew
		into the hearts of men, and kindled the fiercest war. This murder is the indignation of
		incapacity against will, a Judas betrayal that one would like someone else to have
		committed.<a href="#fn107" class="fn">107</a> We are still seeking the goat that should bear
