	<p>
		But on the fourth night I cried:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		<hi>to journey to Hell<br/>
			means to <em>become</em> Hell oneself.<a href="#fn103" class="fn">103</a><br/>
			it is all frightfully<br/>
			muddled and interwoven.</hi><br/>
		<br/>
		on this desert path<br/>
		<hi>there is not just glowing sand,</hi><br/>
		but also horrible<br/>
		tangled<br/>
		invisible beings<br/>
		who live in the desert.<br/>
		<hi>i didn't know this.</hi><br/>
		<br/>
		<hi>the way is only <em>apparently</em> clear,</hi><br/>
		the desert is only <em>apparently</em> empty.<br/>
		it seems inhabited by magical beings<br/>
		<hi>who murderously attach themselves to me<br/>
			and <em>daimonically</em> change my form.</hi><br/>
		<br/>
		i have evidently taken on<br/>
		a completely monstrous form<br/>
		in which <hi>i can<br/>
		no longer<br/>
		recognize myself.</hi><br/>
		<br/>
		it seems to me<br/>
		that I have become<br/>
		<hi>a monstrous animal form<br/>
			for which <b>i have exchanged<br/>
				my humanity.</b></hi><br/>
		<br/>
		this way is surrounded by hellish magic,<br/>
		<hi>invisible nooses<br/>
			have been thrown over me<br/>
			and <b>ensnare me.</b></hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		But the spirit of the depths approached me and said:
	</p>
	<say class="depths">
		<hi>climb down<br/>
			into your depths,<br/>
			sink!</hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		But I was indignant at him and said:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		how can I sink?<br/>
		<hi>i am unable<br/>
			to do this myself</hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		Then the spirit spoke words to me that appeared ridiculous, and he said:
	</p>
	<say class="depths">
		sit yourself down,<br/>
		<hi>be calm.</hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		But I cried out indignantly:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		how frightful,<br/>
		<hi><b>it sounds like <em>nonsense,</em></b><br/>
			do you also demand this of me?</hi><br/>
		you overthrew the mighty Gods<br/>
		who mean the most to us.<br/>
		<br/>
		<hi>my soul,<br/>
			<b>where <em>are</em> you?</hi></b><br/>
		have i entrusted myself to a stupid animal,<br/>
		do I stagger like a drunkard to the grave,<br/>
		<hi>do I stammer stupidities like a lunatic?<br/>
			is <em>this</em> your way,<br/>
			my soul?</hi><br/>
		<br/>
		the blood boils in me<br/>
		and i would strangle you<br/>
		if i could seize you.<br/>
		<hi>you weave<br/>
			the thickest darknesses<br/>
			and i am like a madman<br/>
			caught in your net.<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>but i <em>yearn</em>,<br/>
				<br/>
				<em>teach</em> me.</b></hi><br/>

	<p>
		But my soul spoke to me saying:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		<hi><b>my <em>path</em> is <em>Light.</em></b></hi>
	</say>
	<idea>
		the path, the image of the supreme meaning, the Light, the thing that sounds like Truth,
		looks like Truth, reads like Truth, that mental highlighter extracting understanding from
		the noise, the direction of drift through the madness and non-intention. the <em>way.</em>
		the way does not shy from darkness. the way warns, but does not prevent. the way seeks
		understanding of, and understanding <em>in,</em> opposition.
	</idea>

	<p>
		<hi>Yet I <em>indignantly</em> answered:</hi>
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		do you call <em>Light</em><br/>
		what we men call<br/>
		<em>the worst darkness?</em><br/>
		<hi>do you call <em>day</em><br/>
			<em>night?</em></hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		To this <hi>my soul spoke a word that roused my anger:</hi>
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		<hi><b>my Light<br/>
			is not<br/>
			<em>of this world.</em></b></hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		I cried:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		<hi>i know of no <em>other world.</em></hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		The soul answered:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		<hi>should it <em>not exist</em><br/>
			because <em>you</em><br/>
			<b>know nothing of it?</b></hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		I:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		but our <em>knowledge?</em><br/>
		does our knowledge <em>also</em><br/>
		not hold good for you?<br/>
		<br/>
		<hi>what is it going to be,<br/>
			if not <em>knowledge?</em></hi><br/>
		where is <em>security?</em><br/>
		where is <em>solid ground?</em><br/>
		where is <em>light?</em><br/>
		<br/>
		<hi>your darkness<br/>
			is not only <em>darker</em> than night,<br/>
			but <em>bottomless,</em> as well.</hi><br/>
		<br/>
		if it's not going to be <em>knowledge,</em><br/>
		then perhaps it will do<br/>
		<hi>without <em>speech</em> and <em>words,</em> too?</hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		My soul:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		<hi><b>no <em>words.</em></b></hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		I:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		forgive me,<br/>
		perhaps i'm hard-of-hearing,<br/>
		<hi>perhaps i misinterpret you,<br/>
			perhaps i ensnare myself<br/>
			in self-deceit and <em>monkey</em> business,</hi><br/>
		and i am a rascal<br/>
		grinning at myself<br/>
		in a mirror<br/>
		<hi>a fool<br/>
			in my own madhouse.<br/>
			perhaps you stumble over my folly?</hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		My soul:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		you delude <em>yourself,</em><br/>
		you do not deceive me.<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>your <em>words</em><br/>
			are lies<br/>
			to <em>you,</em><br/>
			not me.</b>
	</say>
	<idea>
		no <em>words.</em> the <em>way</em> emanates to us from some layer above, which speaks in
		probability clouds, in endless possibility, in infinities spread across untold and infinite
		axes, outside of time, eternal. our moves, our events, our <em>words,</em> time itself;
		these collapse the possibilities into <em>deadness</em> -- past, over-and-done, unchanging,
		<em>written into unforgettable books for eternal memory.</em> <em>words</em> are what
		remains of the <em>image</em> after forcing and filtering through a worldly mind.
	</idea>
	<idea>
		perhaps, just like <em>lies,</em> words-as-collapse can be twisted, misinterpreted, denied,
		disproved, forgotten, <em>forgiven.</em> perhaps we reclaim our image-vision, our
		<em>non-sense</em>, by doing exactly that.
	</idea>

	<p>
		I:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		<hi>but could i wallow<br/>
			in <em>raging nonsense,</em></hi><br/>
		and hatch absurdity<br/>
		and perverse monotony?
	</say>

	<p>
		My soul:
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		<hi><b>who <em>gives you</em> thoughts and words?</b><br/>
			do <em>you</em> make them?<br/>
			<br/>
			are you not my <em>serf,</em><br/>
			a <em>recipient</em><br/>
			who <b><em>lies</em></b> at my door<br/>
			and <em>picks up</em> my alms?</hi><br/>
		<br/>
		<hi>and you <em>dare</em> think<br/>
			that what <em>you</em><br/>
			devise and speak<br/>
			<b>could be <em>nonsense?</em></b><br/>
			don't you know yet<br/>
			that <b>it comes from <em>me</em><br/>
				and belongs to <em>me?</em></b> </hi>
	</say>
	<idea>
		nothing devised by man could approach non-sense.
	</idea>

	<p>
		So I cried, <hi>full of anger:</hi>
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		but then my indignation<br/>
		must also <em>come from you,</em><br/>
		and in <em>me</em><br/>
		<b>you are indignant <em>against yourself.</em></b>
	</say>

	<p>
		<hi>My soul then <b>spoke the ambiguous</b> words:</hi>
	</p>
	<say class="soul">
		<hi><em>that</em><br/>
			<br/>
			is<br/>
			<b><em>civil</em> war.</b></hi><a href="#fn104" class="fn">104</a>
	</say>
	<idea>
		if war <em>must</em> be fought, fight as much against yourself as the other. do not love the
		war. love the <em>other,</em> hate the war. minimize suffering, resolve, heal,
		<em>thrive.</em> ask Ender.
	</idea>
	<idea>
		all wars are <em>civil wars.</em> all wars are fought against ourselves, in one way or
		another. yet, it is <em>war,</em> nonetheless. the weak, foolish, and unlucky will fall
		to the strong, prepared, and fortunate. will fall... <em>must</em> fall? is this not the way
		of <em>all</em> life in our world?
	</idea>

	<p>
		I was afflicted with pain and rage, and I answered back:
	</p>
	<say class="self">
		<hi>how painful,<br/>
			my soul,</hi><br/>
		to hear you<br/>
		use <em>hollow</em> words,<br/>
		i feel sick.<br/>
		<br/>
		comedy and drivel--<br/>
		<hi>but i <em>yearn.</em></hi><br/>
		<br/>
		<em>i</em> can also crawl through mud<br/>
		and the most despised banality.<br/>
		<em>i</em> can also eat dust;<br/>
		<em>that</em> is part of Hell.<br/>
		<br/>
		<hi><b>i <em>do not</em> yield,</b><br/>
			i am <em>defiant.</em></hi><br/>
		you can go on devising torments,<br/>
		spider-legged monsters,<br/>
		ridiculous,<br/>
		hideous,<br/>
		frightful theatrical spectacles.<br/>
		<br/>
		<hi>come close,<br/>
			i am <em>ready.</em></hi><br/>
		<br/>
		<em>ready,</em><br/>
		my soul,<br/>
		<em>you</em><br/>
		who are a <em>devil,</em><br/>
		<hi>to wrestle with <em>you,</em> too.</hi><br/>
		<br/>
		you donned<br/>
		the <b>mask</b> of a God,<br/>
		and i <em>worshiped</em> you.<br/>
		now you wear<br/>
		the <b>mask</b> of a <em>devil,</em><br/>
		a frightful one,<br/>
		<hi>the <b>mask</b> of the banal,<br/>
			<b>of eternal mediocrity!</b></hi><br/>
		<br/>
		only one favor!<br/>
		give me a moment<br/>
		to step back and consider!<br/>
		<br/>
		<hi>is the struggle with this <b>mask</b> worthwhile?</hi><br/>
		<br/>
		<hi>was the <b>mask</b> of God <em>worth</em> worshiping?</hi><br/>
		<br/>
		<hi><em>i cannot do it,</em><br/>
			the lust for battle burns in my limbs.<br/>
			<em>no,</em><br/>
			i <em>cannot</em> leave the battlefield defeated.</hi><br/>
		i want to seize you,<br/>
		crush you,<br/>
		<em>monkey</em> buffoon.<br/>
		<br/>
		<hi><em>woe</em> if the struggle is unequal,<br/>
			my hands grab at air.<br/>
			but <em>your</em> blows are also air,<br/>
			and <b>i perceive trickery.</b></hi>
	</say>
	<idea>
		the lust for battle is a part of life; make it also the <em>civil</em> battle.
	</idea>
	<idea>
		in a battle against soul, know that the soul is all things -- <em>must be</em> all things.
		woe to us who cannot see all things at once; we may only see the <em>mask.</em> do not
		conflate the soul with its present mask: it is, and must be, <em>all</em> things underneath.
		it exists among the infinite axes and scales and parameters. a mask is a combination of
		these dimensions; collapsed and deadened for our worldly minds to behold.

		As the first vision had predicted to me, the assassin appeared from the depths, and came to

	</p>
	<p>
		I felt myself transformed into a rapacious beast. My heart glowered in rage against the high

		Because I carried the war in me, I foresaw it. I felt betrayed and lied to by my long. Why

		[...] vision of the desert, I struggled with mirror images of myself It was civil war in me.
		I myself was the murderer and the murdered. The deadly arrow was stuck in my heart, and I

		And thus was the fate of the people: The murder of one was the poisonous arrow that flew
