		<a href="#fn77" class="fn">77</a> After a hard struggle I have come a piece of the way nearer to you. How hard this
		struggle was! I had fallen into an undergrowth of doubt, confusion, and scorn. I recognize
		that I must be alone with my soul. I come with empty hands to you, my soul. What do you want
		to hear? But my soul spoke to me and said:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		if you come to a friend,<br/>
		do you come to take?
	</say>

	<p>
		I knew that this should not be so, but it seems to me that I am poor and empty I would like
		to sit down near you and at least feel the breath of your animating presence. My way is hot
		sand. All day long, sandy dusty paths. My patience is sometimes weak, and once I despaired
		of myself as you know.
	</p>
	<p>
		My soul answered and said:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		you speak to me<br/>
		as if you were a child<br/>
		complaining to its mother.<br/>
		i am not your mother.
	</say>

	<p>
		I do not want to complain, but let me say to you that mine is
		a long and dusty road. You are to me like a shady tree in the wilderness. I would like to
		enjoy your shade. But my soul answered:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		you are pleasure-seeking.<br/>
		where is your patience?<br/>
		your time has not yet run its course.<br/>
		<br/>
		have you forgotten<br/>
		why<br/>
		you went into the desert?
	</say>

	<p>
		My faith is weak, my face is blind from all that shimmering blaze of the desert sun. The
		heat lies on me like lead. Thirst torments me, I dare not think how unendingly long my way
		is, and above all, I see nothing in front of me. But the soul answered:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		you speak as if you have still<br/>
		learned nothing.<br/>
		<br/>
		can you not wait?<br/>
		<br/>
		should everything fall into your lap<br/>
		ripe and finished?<br/>
		<br/>
		you are full, yes,<br/>
		you teem with intentions and desirousness--<br/>
		do you still not know<br/>
		that the way to truth<br/>
		stands open only<br/>
		to those without intentions?
	</say>

	<p>
		I know that everything you say, oh my soul, is also my thought. But I hardly live according
		to it. The soul said:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		how, tell me,<br/>
		do you then believe<br/>
		that your thoughts should help you?
	</say>

	<p>
		I would always like to refer to the fact that I am a human being, just a human being who is
		weak and sometimes does not do his best. But the soul said:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		is this what you think it means<br/>
		to be human?
	</say>

	<p>
		You are hard, my soul, but you are right. How little we still commit ourselves to living. We
		should grow like a tree that likewise does not know its law. We tie ourselves up with
		intentions, not mindful of the fact that intention is the limitation, yes, the exclusion of
		life. We believe that we can illuminate the darkness with an intention, and in that way aim
		past the light.<a href="#fn78" class="fn">78</a> How can we presume to want to know, in advance, from where the light will
		come to us?
	</p>
	<p>
		Let me bring only one complaint before you: I suffer from scorn, my own scorn. But my soul
		said to me:</p>

	<say class="self">
		do you think<br/>
		little of yourself?
	</say>

	<p>
		I do not believe so. My soul answered:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		then listen,<br/>
		do you think little of me?<br/>
		do you still not know<br/>
		that you are not writing a book<br/>
		to feed your vanity<br/>
		but that you are speaking<br/>
		with me?<br/>
		<br/>
		how can you suffer from scorn<br/>
		if you address me with those words<br/>
		that i give you?<br/>
		do you know, then,<br/>
		who I am?<br/>
		<br/>
		have you<br/>
		grasped me,<br/>
		defined me,<br/>
		and made me<br/>
		into a dead formula?<br/>
		have you measured the depths of my chasms,<br/>
		and explored all the ways down which<br/>
		i am yet going to lead you?<br/>
		<br/>
		scorn cannot challenge you<br/>
		if you are not vain<br/>
		to the marrow of your bones.
	</say>

	<p>
		Your truth is hard. I want to lay down my vanity before you, since it blinds me. See, that
		is why I also believed my hands were empty when I came to you today. I did not consider that
		it is you who fills empty hands if only they want to stretch out, yet they do not want to. I
		did not know that I am your vessel, empty without you, but brimming over with you.

		This was my twenty-fifth night in the desert. This is how long it took my soul to awaken
		from a shadowy being to her own life, until she could approach me as a free-standing being
		separate from me. And I received hard but salutary words from her. I needed that taking in
		hand, since I could not overcome the scorn within me.
	</p>

	<hr/>

	<p class="pillar">
		The spirit of this time considers itself extremely clever, like every such spirit of the
		time. But wisdom is simple-minded, not just simple. Because of this, the clever person mocks
		wisdom, since mockery is his weapon. He uses the pointed, poisonous weapon, because he is
		struck by naive wisdom. If he were not struck, he would not need the weapon. Only in the
		desert do we become aware our terrible simple-mindedness, but we are afraid of admitting it.
		That is why we are scornful.

	<p class="pillar">
		But mockery does not attain simple-mindedness. The mockery falls on the mocker, and in the
		desert where no one hears and answers, he suffocates from his own scorn.
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		The cleverer you are, the more foolish your simple-mindedness. The totally clever are total
		fools in their simple-mindedness. We cannot save ourselves from the cleverness of the spirit
		of this time through increasing our cleverness, but through accepting what our cleverness
		hates most, namely simple-mindedness. Yet we also do not want to be artilicial fools because
		we have fallen into simple-mindedness, rather we will be clever fools. That leads to the
		supreme meaning. Cleverness couples itself with intention. Simple-mindedness knows no
		intention. Cleverness conquers the world, but simple-mindedness, the soul. So take on the
		vow of poverty of spirit in order to partake of the soul.<a href="#fn79" class="fn">79</a>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		Against this, the scorn of my cleverness rose up.<a href="#fn80" class="fn">80</a> Many will laugh at my foolishness. But
		no one will laugh more than I laughed at myself.
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		So, I overcame scorn. But when I had overcome it, I was near to my soul, and she could speak
		to me, and I was soon to see the desert becoming green.

				In "Commentary on 'The Secret of the Golden Flower' "(1929), Jung criticized the
				Western tendency to turn everything into methods and intentions. The cardinal
				lesson, as presented by the Chinese texts and by Meister Lockhart, was that of
				allowing psychic events to happen of their own accord: "Letting things happen, the
				action through non-action, the 'letting go of oneself' of Meister Lockhart, became
				the key for me that succeeded in opening the door to the way: One must be able to
				psychically let things happen" (cw 13, ยง2o).

				Christ preached: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
				heaven" (Matthew 5:3). In a number of Christian communities, members take a vow of
				poverty In 1934, lung wrote: "just as in Christianity the vow of worldly poverty
				turned the mind away from the riches of this earth, so spiritual poverty seeks to
				renounce the false riches of the spirit in order to withdraw not only from the sorry
				remnants-which today call themselves the protestant 'cllurches'-of a great past, but
				also from all the allurements of exotic aromas, in order, finally to turn back to
				itself, where, in the cold light of consciousness, the blank barrenness of the world
				reaches to the very stars" ("On the archetypes of the collective unconscious," CW 9,
				I, ยง29).

				The Draft continues: "This, too, is an image of the ancients, that they lived in
				things symbolically: they renounced wealth in order to have a share of the voluntary
				poverty of their souls. Therefore I had to grant my soul my most extreme poverty and
				need. And the scorn of my cleverness rose up against this" (P. 47).
