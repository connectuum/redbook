		HI iii(r) 2
	</note>

	<p>
		<a href="#fn77" class="fn">77</a> After a hard struggle <hi>I have come a <em>piece</em> of
		the way nearer to you. How hard this struggle was! I had fallen into an undergrowth of
		doubt, confusion, and scorn.</hi> I recognize that I must be alone with my soul. I come with
		empty hands to you, my soul. What do you want to hear? But my soul spoke to me and said:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		if you come to a friend,<br/>
		<hi>do you come to take?</hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		I knew that this should not be so, but it seems to me that <hi>I am poor and empty. I would
		like to sit down near you, and at least feel the breath of your animating presence. My way
		is hot sand.</hi> All day long, sandy dusty paths. <hi>My patience is sometimes weak, and
		once I despaired of myself,</hi> as you know.
	</p>
	<p>
		My soul answered, and said:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		you speak to me<br/>
		as if you were a child<br/>
		complaining to its mother.<br/>
		<hi>i am not your mother.</hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		<hi>I do not want to complain,</hi> but let me say to you that mine is a long and dusty
		road. <hi>You are to me like a shady tree in the wilderness. I would like to enjoy your
		shade.</hi> But my soul answered:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		<hi>you are pleasure-seeking.<br/>
			<b>where is your patience?</b><br/>
			your time has not yet run its course.<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>have you forgotten<br/>
				<em>why</em><br/>
				you went into the desert?</b></hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		My faith is weak, my face is blind from all that shimmering blaze of the desert sun. The
		heat lies on me like lead. <hi>Thirst torments me, I dare not think how unendingly long my
		way is, and above all, I see nothing in front of me.</hi> But the soul answered:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		<hi>you speak as if you have still<br/>
			learned <em>nothing.</em><br/>
			<br/>
			can you not <em>wait?</em><br/>
			<br/>
			should everything fall into your lap<br/>
			<em>ripe and finished?</em></hi><br/>
		<br/>
		you are full, yes,<br/>
		you teem with intentions and desirousness--<br/>
		do you still not know<br/>
		that <hi>the way to Truth<br/>
		stands open <em>only</em><br/>
		to <b>those without intentions?</b></hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		<hi>I know that everything you <em>say,</em> oh my soul, is also my <em>thought.</em> But
			I hardly live according to it.</hi> The soul said:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		<hi>how, tell me,<br/>
			do you then believe<br/>
			that your <em>thoughts</em> should help you?</hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		I would always like to refer to the fact that <hi>I am a human being, just a human being who
		is weak and sometimes does not do his best.</hi> But the soul said:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		<hi>is <em>this</em> what you think it means<br/>
			<b>to be human?</b></hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		<hi>You are hard, my soul, but you are right.</hi> How little we still commit ourselves to
		living. We should grow like a tree that likewise does not know its law. <hi>We tie ourselves
		up with intentions, not mindful of the fact that <b>intention is the limitation,</b> yes,
		the <em>exclusion</em> of life. We believe that we can <b>illuminate the darkness</b> with
		an intention, and in that way <b>aim past the Light.</b></hi><a href="#fn78"
			class="fn">78</a> <hi>How can we presume to want to know, in advance, from where the
		Light will come to us?</hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		Let me bring only one complaint before you: <hi>I suffer from scorn, my own scorn.</hi> But
		my soul said to me:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		<hi>do you think little of yourself?</hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		I do not believe so. My soul answered:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		then listen,<br/>
		<hi>do you think little of me?<br/>
			do you still not know</hi><br/>
		that you are not writing a book<br/>
		to feed your vanity<br/>
		but <hi>that <em>you</em> are speaking<br/>
		with <em>me?</em></hi><br/>
		<br/>
		<hi>how can <em>you</em> suffer from scorn<br/>
			if you address <em>me</em><br/>
			with those words that <em>i</em> give you?<br/>
			do you know, then,<br/>
			<b>who <em>i</em> am?</b><br/>
			<br/>
			have you<br/>
			<em>grasped</em> me,<br/>
			<em>defined</em> me,<br/>
			and <em>made</em> me<br/>
			<b>into a dead formula?</b><br/>
			have you measured the depths of my chasms,<br/>
			and explored all the ways down which<br/>
			i am yet going to lead you?<br/>
			<br/>
			scorn cannot challenge you<br/>
			if you are not vain</hi><br/>
		to the marrow of your bones.
	</say>

	<p>
		<hi>Your Truth is hard. I want to lay down my vanity before you, since it blinds me. See,
			that is why I also believed my hands were empty when I came to you today.</hi> I did not
		consider that it is you who fills empty hands if only they want to stretch out, yet they do
		not want to. <hi>I did not know that <b>I am your vessel,</b> empty without you, but
		brimming over <em>with</em> you.</hi>

	<p>
		This was my twenty-fifth night in the desert. This is <hi>how long it took my soul to awaken
		from a shadowy being to her own life, until she could approach me as a free-standing being,
		separate from me.</hi> And I received hard but salutary words from her. I needed that taking
		in hand, since <hi>I could not overcome the scorn within me.</hi>
	</p>

	<hr/>

	<p class="pillar">
		<hi>The spirit of this time considers itself extremely clever,</hi> like every such spirit
		of the time. <hi><b>But wisdom is simple-minded, not just simple.</b></hi> Because of this,
		the
		clever person mocks wisdom, since mockery is his weapon. <hi>He uses the pointed, poisonous
		weapon, because he is struck by <em>naive</em> wisdom. If he were not struck, he would not
		need the weapon. Only in the desert do we become aware our terrible simple-mindedness, but
		<b>we are afraid of admitting it.</b></hi> That is why we are scornful.

		But mockery does not attain simple-mindedness. <hi>The mockery falls on the mocker, and in
		the desert, where no one hears and answers, <b>he suffocates from his own scorn.</b></hi>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		<hi>The cleverer you are, the more foolish your simple-mindedness.</hi> The totally clever
		are total fools in their simple-mindedness. <hi>We cannot save ourselves from the cleverness
		of the spirit of this time through <em>increasing</em> our cleverness, but through
		<b>accepting what our cleverness hates most,</b> namely simple-mindedness.</hi> Yet, we also
		do not want to be <em>artificial</em> fools because we have fallen into simple-mindedness,
		<hi>rather, we will be <em>clever</em> fools. <b>That leads to the supreme meaning.</b></hi>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		<hi>Cleverness couples itself with intention. Simple-mindedness knows no intention.
			Cleverness conquers the world, but simple-mindedness, the soul. So take on the
			vow of <em>poverty of spirit</em> in order <b>to partake of the
				soul.</b><a href="#fn79" class="fn">79</a>

		<hi>Against this, the scorn of my cleverness rose up.</hi><a href="#fn80" class="fn">80</a>
		Many will laugh at my foolishness. <hi>But no one will laugh more than I laughed at
		myself.</hi>
	</p>
	<p class="pillar">
		So, I overcame scorn. But when I had overcome it, <hi>I was near to my soul, and she could
		speak to me, and I was soon to see the desert becoming green.</hi>

				In "Commentary on 'The Secret of the Golden Flower' "(1929), Jung criticized the
				Western tendency to turn everything into methods and intentions. The cardinal
				lesson, as presented by the Chinese texts and by Meister Lockhart, was that of
				allowing psychic events to happen of their own accord: "Letting things happen, the
				action through non-action, the 'letting go of oneself' of Meister Lockhart, became
				the key for me that succeeded in opening the door to the way: One must be able to
				psychically let things happen" (cw 13, ยง2o).

				Christ preached: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
				heaven" (Matthew 5:3). In a number of Christian communities, members take a vow of
				poverty In 1934, lung wrote: "just as in Christianity the vow of worldly poverty
				turned the mind away from the riches of this earth, so spiritual poverty seeks to
				renounce the false riches of the spirit in order to withdraw not only from the sorry
				remnants-which today call themselves the protestant 'cllurches'-of a great past, but
				also from all the allurements of exotic aromas, in order, finally to turn back to
				itself, where, in the cold light of consciousness, the blank barrenness of the world
				reaches to the very stars" ("On the archetypes of the collective unconscious," CW 9,
				I, ยง29).

				The Draft continues: "This, too, is an image of the ancients, that they lived in
				things symbolically: they renounced wealth in order to have a share of the voluntary
				poverty of their souls. Therefore I had to grant my soul my most extreme poverty and
				need. And the scorn of my cleverness rose up against this" (P. 47).
