		cap. iv.
	</note>

	<p>
		<a href="#fn72" class="fn">72</a> Sixth night. <hi>My soul leads me into the desert, into
		the desert of my own self.</hi> I did not think that my soul is a desert, a barren, hot
		desert, dusty and without drink. <hi>The journey leads through hot sand, slowly wading
		without a visible goal to hope for. How eerie is this wasteland. It seems to me that the way
		leads <b>so far away from mankind.</b> I take my way <b>step by step,</b> and do not know
		how long my journey will last.</hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		<hi>Why is my self a desert?</hi> Have I lived too much outside of myself in men and events?
		<hi><b>Why did I avoid my self?</b></hi> Was I not dear to myself? <hi>But I have avoided
		<b>the place of my soul.</b> I <em>was</em> my thoughts, after I <em>was no longer</em>
		events and other men.</hi> But I was not my self, confronted with my thoughts. I should also
		<hi>rise up above my thoughts to my own self. My journey goes there,</hi>
		and that is why it leads away from men and events into solitude. Is it solitude, to be with
		oneself? <hi>Solitude is True only when the self is a desert.</hi><a href="#fn73"
			class="fn">73</a>
	</p>

	<idea>
		my desert is glorious imagination denied by a wasteland of dread. my gears ever-churning,
		rooting relentlessly into the barren stratum. empty gasps of dead air. feeling no Light,
		forgetting it exists. feeling no hope, but clawing desparately into reasons for it. standing
		in one place, living in another. seeking only for solitude, quiet, calm -- anything to
		to ease the intense turbulence, the wake of standard-issue waves of life. what can i
		do here? where is my escape from this dread and useless state?
	</idea>

	<p>
		Should I also make a garden out of the desert? Should I people a desolate land? <hi>Should I
		open the airy magic garden of the wilderness? What leads me into the desert, and what am I
		to do there? Is it a deception that I can no longer trust my thoughts? Only life is true,
		and only life leads me into the desert,</hi> truly not my thinking, that would like to
		return to thoughts, to men and events, since it feels uncanny in the desert. <hi>My soul,
		what am I to do here?</hi> But my soul spoke to me and said:
	</p>

	<say class="soul">
		<hi><b><em>wait</em></b></hi>
	</say>

	<p>
		<hi>I heard the cruel word. <b>Torment belongs to the
			desert.</b></hi><a href="#fn74" class="fn">74</a>
	</p>

	<idea>
		wait. the agony, <b><em>wait</em></b> until i can calibrate once more. until i can return to
		the great black hunt, to grand branching expeditions through the imaginary unknowns, to
		relentless pursuit of idea, to crystallization of idea into code, to keeping my head
		above the waves.
	</idea>

	<p>
		<hi>Through giving my soul all I could give,</hi> I came to the place of the soul and found
		that this place was a hot desert, desolate and unfruitful. <hi>No culture of the mind is
		enough to make a garden out of your soul.</hi> I had cultivated my spirit, the spirit of
		this time in me, but not that spirit of the depths that turns to the things of the soul, the
		world of the soul. The soul has its own peculiar world. <hi>Only the self enters in there,
		or the man who has completely become his self, he who is neither in events, nor in men, nor
		in his thoughts. Through <b>the turning of my desire</b> from things and men, I <b>turned my
			self</b> away from things and men, but that is precisely how I became the secure prey of
		my thoughts, yes, I <b>wholly became my thoughts.</b></hi>
	</p>

	<p>
		<hi>I also had to detach myself from my thoughts through turning my desire away from
			them.</hi> And
		at once, I noticed that my self became a desert, <hi>where only the sun of unquiet desire
		burned. I was overwhelmed by the endless infertility</hi> of this desert. Even if something
		could
		have thrived there, <hi>the creative power of desire was still absent. Wherever the creative
		power of desire is, there springs the soil's own seed. But do not forget to wait.</hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		<hi>Did you
			not see that when your creative force <b>turned to the world,</b> how <b>the dead things
				moved</b> under
			it and through it, how they grew and prospered, and <b>how your thoughts flowed in rich
				rivers?</b>
			If your creative force now turns to the <b>place of the soul</b>, you will see how your
			soul
			becomes green and how its field <b>bears wonderful fruit.</b></hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		<hi>Nobody can spare themselves the waiting, and most will be <b>unable to bear this
			torment,</b>
			but will throw themselves with greed back at men, things, and thoughts, <b>whose slaves
				they will become</b> from then on.</hi> Since then it will have been <hi>clearly
		proved that this man is <b>incapable of <em>enduring</em></b> beyond things, men, and
		thoughts, and
		they will hence <b>become his master</b> and he will become their fool, since <em>he</em>
		cannot <em>be</em> without them,</hi> not until even his soul has become a fruitful field.
		Also <hi>he whose soul is a garden, needs things, men, and thoughts, but he is their <b>friend</b>
		and <em>not</em> their slave and fool.</hi>

		<hi>Everything to come was already in images: to find their soul, the ancients went into the
			desert.</hi><a href="#fn75" class="fn">75</a> <hi><em>This is an image:</em> The
		ancients <em>lived</em> their symbols, since the world <b>had not yet become
			<em>real</em></b> for
		them.</hi> Thus they went into <em>the solitude of the desert</em> to teach us that the
		place of the soul is a lonely desert. There they found <hi>the abundance of visions, the
		fruits of the desert, the wondrous flowers of the soul.</hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		<hi>Think diligently about the images
			that the ancients have left behind. They show the way of <b>what is to come.</b></hi>
		Look
		back at the collapse of empires, of growth and death, of the desert and monasteries,
		<hi>they are <b>the images</b> of what is to come. Everything has been foretold.</hi> But
		who knows how to interpret it?
	</p>

	<idea>
		a recursion is a foretelling, isn't it? a pathway through the same function over again,
		perhaps given different starting conditions, with the function's historical side-effects
		present throughout the data-state. perhaps we could cluster <em>image</em> with words like
		<em>rhyme</em>, <em>reflection</em>, <em>pattern</em>, <em>template</em>, <em>branch</em>,
		<em>ghost</em>, <em>echo</em>. these images depicting the cycle of growth and death, these
		are the <em>rhymes</em> of recursion, the results of endless execution upon scenarios across
		historical time and at various scales.
	</idea>

	<idea>
		an image of planetary desolation, of small bands of humans, protected,
		<em>intractable</em> and <em>blooming</em> against the waste. collapse of empires. monasteries
		in the desert. images of what is to come.
	</idea>

	<p>
		When you say that the place of the soul is not, then it is not. <hi>But if you say that it
		is, then it <b><em>is.</em></b></hi> Notice what the ancients said in images: <hi>the word
		is a <em>creative act.</em> <b>The ancients said: in the beginning was the
			<em>Word.</em></b></hi><a href="#fn76" class="fn">76</a> <hi>Consider this and think
		upon it.</hi>
	</p>
	<p>
		<hi>The words that oscillate between <em>nonsense</em> and <em>supreme meaning</em> are
			<b>the oldest and Truest.</b></hi>
	</p>

	<idea>
		nonsense : supreme meaning {as} laughter : worship<br/>
		(the measures of the sum of life)

				Around 285, St. Anthony went to live as a hermit in the Egyptian desert, and other
				hermits followed, whom he and Pachomius organized into a community. This formed the
				basis of Christian monasticism, which spread to the Palestinian and Syrian deserts.
				In the fourth century, there were thousands of monks in the Egyptian desert. 76 John
