	<p>
		Like a tired wanderer who had sought nothing in the world apart from her, shall I come
		closer to my soul. I shall learn that my soul finally lies behind everything, and if I cross
		the world, I am ultimately doing this to find my soul. Even the dearest are themselves not
		the goal and end of the love that goes on seeking, they are symbols of their own souls.
	</p>
	<p>
		My friends, do you guess to what solitude we ascend?
	</p>
	<p>
		I must learn that the dregs of my thought, my dreams, are the speech of my soul. I must
		carry them in my heart, and go back and forth over them in my mind, like the words of the
		person dearest to me. Dreams are the guiding words of the soul. Why should I henceforth not
		love my dreams and not make their fiddling images into objects of my daily consideration?
		You think that the dream is foolish and ungainly. What is beautiful? What is ungainly? What
		is clever? What is foolish? The spirit of this time is your measure, but the spirit of the
		depths surpasses it at both ends. Only the spirit of this time knows the difference between
		large and small. But this difference is invalid, like the spirit which recognizes it.
	</p>

	<idea>
		perhaps the spirit of the depths thinks recursively, then, where the fractal simply
		repeats at scale. from this perspective, the varied dressings of different scales is
		simply noise upon the endlessly-flowing depthwise recursion.

	</note>

	<p>
		The spirit of the depths even taught me to consider my action and my decision as dependent
		on dreams. Dreams pave the way for life, and they determine you without you understanding
		their language.<a href="#fn53" class="fn">53</a> One would like to learn this language, but
		who can teach and learn it?
		Scholarliness alone is not enough, there is a knowledge of the heart that gives deeper
		insight.<a href="#fn54" class="fn">54</a> The knowledge of the heart is in no book and is
		not to be found in the mouth of
		any teacher, but grows out of you like the green seed from the dark earth. Scholarliness
		belongs to the spirit of this time, but this spirit in no way grasps the dream, since the
		soul is everywhere that scholarly knowledge is not.
	</p>
	<p>
		But how can I attain the knowledge of the heart? You can attain this knowledge only by
		living your life to the full. You live your life fully if you also live what you have never
		yet lived, but have left for others to live or to think.<a href="#fn55" class="fn">55</a>
		You will say:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		but <em>i</em> cannot live or think<br/>
		everything that <em>others</em> live or think.
	</say>

	<p>
		But you <em>should</em> say:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		the life that i <em>could</em> still live,<br/>
		i <em>should</em> live,<br/>
		and the thoughts that i <em>could</em> still think,<br/>
		i <em>should</em> think.
	</say>

	<p>
		It appears as though you want to flee from yourself so as not to have to live what
		remains unlived until now.<a href="#fn56" class="fn">56</a> But you cannot flee from
		yourself. It is with you all the time and demands fulfillment. If you pretend to be blind
		and dumb to this demand, you feign being blind and deaf to yourself. This way you will never
		reach the knowledge of the heart.
	</p>
	<p>
		The knowledge of your heart is how your heart is.
	</p>
	<p>
		From a cunning heart you will know cunning.
	</p>
	<p>
		From a good heart you will know goodness.
	</p>
	<p>
		So that your understanding becomes perfect, consider that your
		heart is both good and evil. You ask:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		what?<br/>
		should i also live evil?
	</say>

	<p>
		The spirit of the depths demands:
	</p>

	<say class="depths">
		the life that you could still live,<br/>
		you should live.<br/>
		<br/>
		<em>well-being</em> decides,<br/>
		not your well-being,<br/>
		not the well-being of the others,<br/>
		but only well-being.
	</say>

	<p>
		Well-being is between me and others, in society I, too, lived -- which I had not done
		before, and which I could still do. I lived into the depths, and the depths began to speak.
		The depths taught me the other truth. It thus united sense and nonsense in me.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had to recognize that I an only the expression and symbol of the soul. In the sense of the
		spirit of the depths, I am as I am in this visible world a symbol of my soul, and I am
		thoroughly a serf completely subjugated, utterly obedient. The spirit of the depths taught
		me to say:
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		i am the servant<br/>
		of a <em>child.</em>
	</say>

	<p>
		Through this dictum I learn above all the most extreme humility as what I most need.
	</p>
	<p>
		The spirit of this time of course allowed me to believe in my reason. He let me see myself
		in the image of a leader with ripe thoughts. But the spirit of the depths teaches me that I
		am a servant, in fact the servant of a child. This dictum was repugnant to me and I hated
		it. But I had to recognize and accept that my soul is a child and that my God in my soul is
		a child.<a href="#fn56" class="fn">56</a>

		My God is a child, so wonder not that the spirit of this time in me is incensed to mockery
		and scorn. There will be no one who will laugh at me as I laughed at myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your God should not be a man of mockery rather you yourself will be the man of mockery You
		should mock yourself and rise above this. If you have still not learned this from the old

	<p>
		Is there any one among you who believes he can be spared the way? Can he swindle his way

		You do not overcome the old teaching through doing less, but through doing more. Every step

				The Draft continues: "How thick the earlier darkness was! How impetuous and how

				In 1912, Jung endorsed Maeder's notion of the prospective fiction of the dream (''An
				attempt at an account of psychoanalytic theory," CW 4, §452). In a discussion in the
				ZUrich Psychoanalytical Society on January 31,1913, Jlmg said: "The dream is not
				only the fulfillment ofinfatltile desires, but also symbolizes the future ... The
				dream provides the answer through the symbol, which one must understand" (MZS, p.

				This echoes Blaise Pascal's famous statement, "The heart has its reasons of which

			<li>
				<a id="fn55">55</a>
				In 1912, Jung argued that scholarliness was insufficient if one wanted to become a
				"knower of the human soul." To do this, one had to "hang up exact science and put
				away the scholar's gown, to say farewell to his study and wander with human heart
				through the world, through the horror of prisons, mad houses and hospitals, through
				drab suburban pubs, in brothels and gambling dens, through the salons of elegant
				society, the stock exchanges, the socialist meetings, the churches, the revivals and
				ecstasies of the sects, to experience love, hate and passion in every form in one's
				body" ("New paths of psychology," cw 7, §409).

			<li>
				<a id="fn56">56</a>
				In 1931, Jung commented on the pathogenic consequences of the unlived life of
				parents upon their children: "What usually has the strongest psychic effect on the
				child is the life which the parents ... have not lived. This statement would be
				rather too perfunctory and superficial ifwe did not add by way ofqualification: that
				part of their lives which might have been lived had not certain somewhat threadbare
				excuses prevented the parents from doing so" ("Introduction to Frances Wickes,
				'Analyse der Kinderseele: " CW 17, §87).
			</li>
			<li>
				<a id="fn57">57</a>
				In the 1925 seminar, Jung explained his thoughts at this time: "These ideas about
				the anima and animus led me ever further afield into metaphysical problems, and more
				things crept up for reexamination. At that time I was on the Kantian basis that
				there were things that could never be solved and that therefore shouLd not be
				speculated about, but it seemed to me that if I could find such definite ideas about
				the anima, it was quite worthwhile to try to formulate a conception of God. But I
				could arrive at nothing satisfactory and thought for a time that perhaps the anima
				figure was the deity I said to myself that perhaps men had had a female God
				originally, but growing tired of being governed by women, they had then overthrown
				this God. I practically threw the whole metaphysical problem into the anima and
				conceived of it as the dominating spirit of psyche. In this way I got into a
				psychological argument with myself about the problem of God" (Analytical Psychology,
				p. 46).
			</li>
			<li>
				<a id="fn58">58</a>
				In 1940, Jung presented a study of the motif of the divine child in a collaborative
				volume with the Hungarian classicist Karl Kérenyi (see "On the psychology of the
				child archetype, CW 9, I). lung wrote that the child motif occurs frequently in the
				individuation process. It does not represent one's literal childhood as is
				emphasized by its mythological name. It compensates the residedness of consciousness
				and paves the way for the future development of the personality In certain
				conditions of conflict, the unconscious psyche produces a symbol that unites the
				opposites. The child is such a symbol. It anticipates the self, which is produced
				through the synthesis of the conscious and unconscious elements of the personality
				The typical fates that befall the child indicate the kind of psychic events
				accompanying the genesis of the self. The wonderful birth of the child indicates
				that this happens psychically as opposed to physically.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a id="fn59">59</a>
				In 1940, Jung wrote: "an essential aspect of the child motif is its futural
				character. The child is potential future" ("On the psychology of the child

				The Draft continues: "My friends, as you can see, mercy is granted to the developed,
				not the childish. I thank my God for this message. Do not let the teachings of
				Christianity deceive you! Its teachings are good for the most mature minds of bygone
				time. Today it serves immature minds. Christianity no longer promises us grace, and
				yet we still need mercy That which I tell you is the way of what is to come, my way
				to mercy" (p. 27).
