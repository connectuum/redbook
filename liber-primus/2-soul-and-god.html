		On the second night I called out to my soul:^46
	</p>

	<say class="self">
		i am weary my soul,<br/>
		my wandering has lasted too long,<br/>
		my search for<br/>

		<br/>
		now i have gone through events<br/>
		and find<br/>
		<em>you</em> behind<br/>
		all of them.<br/>
		<br/>
		for i made discoveries on my erring<br/>
		through events,<br/>
		humanity,<br/>
		and the world.<br/>
		i found men.<br/>
		and you, my soul, i found again,<br/>
		first in images <em>within</em> men<br/>
		and then<br/>
		you<br/>
		yourself.<br/>
		<br/>
		i found you where i least expected you.<br/>
		you climbed out of a dark shaft.<br/>
		you announced yourself to me<br/>
		in advance<br/>
		in dreams.^47<br/>
		they burned in my heart and drove me<br/>
		to all the boldest acts of daring,<br/>
		and forced me to<br/>

		<br/>
		you let me see Truths of which<br/>

		you let me undertake journeys,<br/>

	<say class="self">

		<b>thinking recursively:</b> (where/how/when) does a (structure/pattern) repeat itself at

	<p>
		Like a tired wanderer who had sought nothing in the world apart from her, shall I come
		closer to my soul. I shall learn that my soul finally lies behind everything, and if I cross
		the world, I am ultimately doing this to find my soul. Even the dearest are themselves not
		the goal and end of the love that goes on seeking, they are symbols of their own souls.
	</p>
	<p>
		My friends, do you guess to what solitude we ascend?
	</p>
	<p>
		I must learn that the dregs of my thought, my dreams, are the speech of my soul. I must
		carry them in my heart, and go back and forth over them in my mind, like the words of the
		person dearest to me. Dreams are the guiding words of the soul. Why should I henceforth not
		love my dreams and not make their fiddling images into objects of my daily consideration?
		You think that the dream is foolish and ungainly. What is beautiful? What is ungainly? What
		is clever? What is foolish? The spirit of this time is your measure, but the spirit of the
		depths surpasses it at both ends. Only the spirit of this time knows the difference between
		large and small. But this difference is invalid, like the spirit which recognizes it.
	</p>

	<ibid>
		perhaps the spirit of the depths thinks recursively, then, where the fractal simply
		repeats at scale. from this perspective, the varied dressings of different scales is
		simply noise upon the endlessly-flowing depthwise recursion.
	</ibid>

	<note>
		fol. ii(r) / ii(v)
	</note>

	<p>
		The spirit of the depths even taught me to consider my action and my decision as dependent
		on dreams. Dreams pave the way for life, and they determine you without you understanding
		their language.^53 One would like to learn this language, but who can teach and learn it?
		Scholarliness alone is not enough, there is a knowledge of the heart that gives deeper
		insight.^54 The knowledge of the heart is in no book and is not to be found in the mouth of
		any teacher, but grows out of you like the green seed from the dark earth. Scholarliness
		belongs to the spirit of this time, but this spirit in no way grasps the dream, since the
		soul is everywhere that scholarly knowledge is not.
	</p>
	<p>
		But how can I attain the knowledge of the heart? You can attain this knowledge only by
		living your life to the full. You live your life fully if you also live what you have never
		yet lived, but have left for others to live or to think.^55 You will say: "But I cannot live
		or think everything that others live or think." But you <em>should</em> say: "The life
		that I could still live, I should live, and the thoughts that I could still think, I should
		think." It appears as though you want to flee from yourself so as not to have to live what
		remains unlived until now.^56 But you cannot flee from [TODO]
